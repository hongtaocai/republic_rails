The Semantic Product Memory: An Interactive Black Box for Smart Objects.
Wolfgang Wahlster 
Low-cost and compact digital storage, sensors and radio modules make it possible to embed a digital memory into a product for recording all relevant events throughout the entire lifecycle of the artifact. By capturing and interpreting ambient conditions and user actions, such computationally enhanced products have a data shadow and are able to perceive and control their environment, to analyze their observations and to communicate with other smart objects and human users about their lifelog data. In the introductory section of this chapter, we illustrate the innovation and application potential offered through the concept of semantic product memories by an imaginative scenario. Then we provide a taxonomy of the wide variety of digital object memories.

Supervised Learning.
P ,Matthieu Cord ,Sarah Jane Delany 
Supervised learning accounts for a lot of research activity in machine learning and many supervised learning techniques have found application in the processing of multimedia content. The defining characteristic of supervised learning is the availability of annotated training data. The name invokes the idea of a \u2018supervisor\u2019 that instructs the learning system on the labels to associate with training examples. Typically these labels are class labels in classification problems.

The Evolution of a Connectionist Model of Situated Human Language Understanding.
Marshall R. Mayberry ,Matthew W. Crocker 
The Adaptive Mechanisms in Human Language Processing (ALPHA) project features both experimental and computational tracks designed to complement each other in the investigation of the cognitive mechanisms that underlie situated human utterance processing. The models developed in the computational track replicate results obtained in the experimental track and, in turn, suggest further experiments by virtue of behavior that arises as a by-product of their operation.

From Resource-Adaptive Navigation Assistance to Augmented Cognition.
Hubert D. Zimmer ,Stefan M ,J 
In an assistance scenario, a computer provides purposive information supporting a human user in an everyday situation. Wayfinding with navigation assistance is a prototypical assistance scenario. The present chapter analyzes the interplay of the resources of the assistance system and the resources of the user. The navigation assistance system provides geographic knowledge, positioning information, route planning, spatial overview information, and route commands at decision points. The user\u2019s resources encompass spatial knowledge, spatial abilities and visuo-spatial working memory, orientation strategies, and cultural habit. Flexible adaptations of the assistance system to available resources of the user are described, taking different wayfinding goals, situational constraints, and individual differences into account. Throughout the chapter, the idea is pursued that the available resources of the user should be kept active.

Perspectives on Reasoning About Time.
Martin Charles Golumbic 
Reasoning and acting within the time constraints of the real world are among the most fundamental notions of intelligence. Understanding the nature and structure of such constraints can help to find a satisfying solution or find a relaxation when no solution can be found. Given certain explicit temporal relationships between events, we may have the ability to infer additional relationships which are implicit in those given. For example, the transitivity of \u201cbefore\u201d and \u201ccontains\u201d may allow inferring information regarding the sequence of events. Such inferences are essential in story understanding, planning and causal reasoning. Temporal information may be qualitative where events are represented by abstract time points and time intervals, and we process and deduce relationships between them, such as pairs intersecting each other, one preceding, following or containing another, etc. Other information may be quantitative where durations can be measured, precise time stamps may be available, or numerical methods can be applied to understand a specific time line of events. We will explore a variety of these topics.

3D Simulation: the Key to A.I.
Keith Hoyes 
The proposal is a radical one \u2014 that human cognition is significantly weaker than we presume and AI significantly closer than we dared hope. I believe that the human mind is largely made up of tricks and sleights of hand that enamor us with much pride; but our pedestal might not be quite so high or robust as we imagine. I will pursue the argument that human cognition is based largely on 3D simulation and as such is particularly vulnerable to co-option by future advances in animation software.

Smart package solutions may support a patient in the intake of medication\u2014for instance, through the package\u2019s form factor or by linking of the package with digital data and services built upon these data. This chapter discusses the application potential of a so-called digital product memory in this domain. The starting point is a visionary scenario in which the interplay of intelligent environments and medicine packages equipped with digital product memories allows for unobtrusive support of a patient in dealing with situations that might affect his or her therapy compliance. In this chapter, components of a technical infrastructure of particular relevance to the envisioned kind of support are described. This discussion is complemented with a review of prototype implementations of interaction mechanisms taken from the scenario.

Controlling Interaction with Digital Product Memories.
Patrick Gebhard 
Creating intelligent interactive applications based on DPMs is a challenging task. The definition of system reactions, independent interface behaviors, and necessary context data requires expert programmers at various representation levels and often results in hard-to-maintain code. We use the Visual SceneMaker authoring tool, a visual authoring approach which was initially designed for the creation of interactive applications with virtual characters and has been extended to serve as a dialog and interaction manager for our DPM interactive applications. In SceneMaker a clean separation of content (scenes) and logic (sceneflow) is enforced. In order to access high-level context information, the SceneMaker tool provides interfaces to the Object Memory Server (OMS) and to knowledge deduction systems, such as the Java Expert System Shell (JESS). The tool also supports concurrency, variable scoping, and interaction history to facilitate modeling of multiple interaction modalities, robust data access, and flexible interruption policies as they occur in intelligent interactive environments with DPMs. Moreover, the version used allows real-time sceneflow visualization and modification at runtime to facilitate rapid prototyping and code maintenance.

The Logic of Intelligence.
Pei Wang 
Is there an \u201cessence of intelligence\u201d that distinguishes intelligent systems from non-intelligent systems? If there is, then what is it? This chapter suggests an answer to these questions by introducing the ideas behind the NARS (Nonaxiomatic Reasoning System) project. NARS is based on the opinion that the essence of intelligence is the ability to adapt with insufficient knowledge and resources. According to this belief, the author has designed a novel formal logic, and implemented it in a computer system. Such a \u201clogic of intelligence\u201d provides a unified explanation for many cognitive functions of the human mind, and is also concrete enough to guide the actual building of a general purpose \u201cthinking machine\u201d.

The New AI: General 
J 
Most traditional artificial intelligence (AI) systems of the past 50 years are either very limited, or based on heuristics, or both. The new millennium, however, has brought substantial progress in the field of theoretically optimal and practically feasible algorithms for prediction, search, inductive inference based on Occam\u2019s razor, problem solving, decision making, and reinforcement learning in environments of a very general type. Since inductive inference is at the heart of all inductive sciences, some of the results are relevant not only for AI and computer science but also for physics, provoking nontraditional predictions based on Zuse\u2019s thesis of the computer-generated universe.

Integrating Smart Classroom and Language Services.
Yue Suo ,Yuanchun Shi ,Toru Ishida 
The real-time interactive virtual classroom with tele-education experience is an important approach in distance learning. However, most current systems fail to meet the new challenges raised by the development of the serviceoriented architecture. First, the learning systems should be able to facilitate easier integration of increasingly dedicated services, such as language services on the Internet. Second, the learning systems must open their internal interfaces as web services to other systems, so as to enable deeper integration of these systems and easier deployment. Third, the systems are expected to provide flexible interfaces to support mobile device interaction. To address these issues, we build a prototype system, called Open Smart Classroom, by upgrading the original Smart Classroom into a service-oriented open system. With the help of Language Grid services, two Open Smart Classrooms deployed in Tsinghua University and Kyoto University are connected and experimental co-classes have been successfully held. The results of the user study show that integrating Smart Classroom and language services is an interesting and promising approach to building future multicultural distant learning systems.

Collaborative Translation Protocols.
Daisuke Morita ,Toru Ishida 
In this chapter, we present a protocol for collaborative translation, where two non-bilingual people who use different languages collaborate to perform the task of translation using machine translation (MT) services. The key idea of this protocol is that one person, who handles the source language and knows the original sentence (source language side), evaluates the adequacy between the original sentence and the translation of the sentence made fluent by the other person, who handles the target language (target language side). In addition, by determining whether the meaning of the machine-translated sentence is understandable, it is ensured that the two non-bilingual people can do the above tasks without stopping the protocol. As a result, this protocol 1) improves MT quality; and 2) terminates successfully only when the translation result becomes adequate and fluent. An experiment shows that when the protocol terminates successfully, the quality of the translation is increased to about 83 percent for Japanese-English translation and 91 percent for Japanese-Chinese translation. We contributed to the Language Grid Project by proposing a new way to use MT services efficiently in real fields.

Considering the Aesthetics of Ubiquitous Displays.
Noam Tractinsky ,Eleanor Eytam 
We call attention to the important role that aesthetics, or visual beauty, can and should play in the deployment of ubiquitous displays. Following a short survey of the emergence of visual aesthetics in the field of human-computer interaction (HCI), we suggest that the importance of aesthetics stem from three main perspectives. The design perspective suggests that beauty is a cornerstone of any design discipline and that it is often positively related to other practices of good HCI design, such as usability. From a psychological perspective we argue that aesthetics induces pleasure and satisfies human needs; and that it is influential in how people form first impressions and subsequent attitudes. Finally, we argue that aesthetics has an important practical role as a differentiating factor between interactive products. Even more importantly, it is already woven into the socio-technical web of our time. We discuss the implications of this position for the design of ubiquitous displays.

Audience Measurement for Digital Signage: Exploring the Audience's Perspective.
J ,Keith Cheverst 
Electronic displays, or digital signs, are rapidly being installed in many public contexts. Increasingly, these signs are equipped with audience measurement, that is, sensors that observe the audience of the signs. However, the audience\u2019s experience with audience measurement is not yet well understood, which can be a problem, because the audience may feel observed and that their privacy has been violated. In this paper, we explore the audience\u2019s experience with audience measurement for digital signage. We have deployed and evaluated two digital signage systems with different audience measurement techniques, one for a year, and the other for 5 years. We explore the audience\u2019s perspective on the employed audience measurement techniques through repertory grid interviews with users who had significant experience as audiences of both deployments.

Language Service Ontology.
Yoshihiko Hayashi ,Thierry Declerck ,Nicoletta Calzolari ,Monica Monachini ,Claudia Soria ,Paul Buitelaar 
The Language Grid is a distinctive language service infrastructure in the sense that it accommodates a wide variety of user needs, ranging from technical novices to experts; language resource consumers to language resource providers. As these language services are various in type and each of them can be idiosyncratic in many aspects, the service infrastructure has to address the issue of interoperability. A key to solve this issue is not only to build the services around standardized resources and interfaces, but also to establish a knowledge structure that copes effectively with a range of language services. Given this knowledge structure, referred to as a service ontology, each language service can be systematically classified and its usage specified by a corresponding API. This not only enables the utilization of existing language resources but facilitates the dissemination of newly created language resources as services.

From Research to Practice: Automated Negotiations with People.
Raz Lin ,Sarit Kraus 
The development of proficient automated agents has flourished in recent years, yet making the agents interact with people has still received little attention. This is mainly due to the unpredictable nature of people and their negotiation behavior, though complexity and costs attached to experimentation with people, starting from the design and ending with the evaluation process, is also a factor. Even so, succeeding in designing proficient automated agents remains an important objective. In recent years, we have invested much effort in facilitating the design and evaluation of automated agents interacting with people, making it more accessible to researchers. We have created two distinct environments for bargaining agents, as well as proposing a novel approach for evaluating agents. These are key factors for making automated agents become a reality rather than remain theoretical.

Humans in the Loop of Localization Processes.
Donghui Lin 
The Language Grid is a service-oriented infrastructure for language services. In the Language Grid, machine translation services play important roles in supporting multilingual activities for communities. Although the effectiveness of using machine translation services for multilingual communication has been shown in previous reports, the gap between human translators and machine translators remains huge especially in the domain of localization processes that require high translation quality. In this chapter, we aim at improving localization processes by introducing humans into the loop to utilize machine translation services. We try to compare several different types of localization processes (i.e., absolute machine translation processes, absolute human translation processes and processes by human and machine translation services) in the dimensions of translation quality and translation cost. The experiment results show that monolinguals can help improve the translation quality of machine translators with the aid of community dictionary services, and that collaboration of human and machine translation services make it possible to reduce the cost compared with absolute human translations.

Conservative Learning for Object Detectors.
Peter M. Roth ,Horst Bischof 
In this chapter we will introduce a new effective framework for learning an object detector. The main idea is to minimize the manual effort when learning a classifier and to combine the power of a discriminative classifier with the robustness of a generative model. Starting with motion detection an initial set of positive examples is obtained by analyzing the geometry (aspect ratio) of the motion blobs. Using these samples a discriminative classifier is trained using an online version of AdaBoost. In fact, applying this classifier nearly all objects are detected but there is a great number of false positives. Thus, we apply a generative classifier to verify the obtained detections and to decide if a detected patch represents the object of interest or not. As we have a huge amount of data (video stream) we can be very conservative and use only patches for (positive or negative) updates if we are very confident about our decision. Applying this update rules, an incrementally better classifier is obtained without any user interaction. Moreover, an already trained classifier can be retrained online and can therefore easily be adapted to a completely different scene. We demonstrate the framework on different scenarios including pedestrian and car detection.

In recent years, there has been much interest in the potential for situated displays to support sense of community. In this chapter, we describe our experiences of two significant situated display-based deployments which explore some of the issues that arise when such systems are used on a day to day basis. The first deployment described is that of the Hermes system which has been deployed and evaluated in both a University department and a domestic home setting. The second deployment is the Wray photo display which has been deployed in two locations in a rural village located in the north of England. Both deployments made strong use of user-centered design and have benefitted from longitudinal evaluation in order to provide key insights into issues of adoption and appropriation.

Conflicting Constraints in Resource-Adaptive Language Comprehension.
Andrea Weber ,Matthew W. Crocker ,Pia Knoeferle 
The primary goal of psycholinguistic research is to understand the architectures and mechanisms that underlie human language comprehension and production. This entails an understanding of how linguistic knowledge is represented and organized in the brain and a theory of how that knowledge is accessed when we use language. Research has traditionally emphasized purely linguistic aspects of on-line comprehension, such as the influence of lexical, syntactic, semantic and discourse constraints, and their tim -course. It has become increasingly clear, however, that nonlinguistic information, such as the visual environment, are also actively exploited by situated language comprehenders.

DPM Mapper: A Concept to Bridge the Gap Between XML-Based Digital Product Memories and Their Binary Representation.
Marc Sei ,Peter Stephan ,Jochen Schlick ,Ines Dahmann 
In this chapter we introduce a concept that improves the use of Digital Product Memory (DPM) on industrial embedded control systems to control decentralized production processes. The core of this concept is an XML schema that supports the specification of machine-readable mappings between an XML-based and binary DPM representation. This supports the separate description of the DPM information used for production control and its binary memory representation, e.g., on RFID tags. A\u00a0server that stores those XML mapping documents and processes the address queries from the embedded production control systems has been developed. To demonstrate the feasibility of the approach this mapping technology was implemented in a demonstration module which was presented at Hannover Messe 2010.

In comparison with the classic query-by-example paradigm, the \u201cmental image search\u201d paradigm lifts the strong assumption that the user has a relevant example at hand to start the search. In this chapter, we review different methods that implement this paradigm, originating from both the content-based image retrieval and the object recognition fields. In particular, we present two complementary methods. The first one allows the user to reach the target mental image by relevance feedback, using a Bayesian inference. The second one lets the user specify the mental image visual composition from an automatically generated visual thesaurus of segmented regions.

Virtual Technologies and Empowerment of Users of Rehabilitation.
Naomi Schreuer ,Patrice L. (Tamar) Weiss 
Empowerment is a multi-dimensional social process that helps people gain control over their own lives. Empowerment of people with disabilities entails the motivation to control as well as the knowledge and skills to adapt to and influence one\u2019s own rehabilitation process. The goal of empowered rehabilitation is to guide users to achieve their maximal independence by developing the skills necessary to overcome the physical, social and emotional barriers in their lives. We are currently witnessing a profound change in social attitudes where, after years of repression, people with disabilities struggle for their human rights and for control over resources. Information and communication technologies (ICT) have been used to empower populations who are weak due to gender, poverty, rural residence, age and disability. In this chapter, we have applied a model of patterns of social change to show how the use of novel ICT technologies may contribute to social change and empowerment of people with disabilities. Each of the model\u2019s four patterns \u2013 social planning, social reform, social development and social action \u2013 is illustrated with an example of the role of technology during this process. Lessons learned during the empowerment process for people with disabilities may also be incorporated into general ICT programs to help enhance usage in additional segments of the population including minority groups as well as those who have traditionally been challenged in this area (e.g. the elderly, people who live in remote locations).

Dependency Grammar: Classification and Exploration.
Ralph Debusmann ,Marco Kuhlmann 
Syntactic representations based on word-to-word dependencies have a long tradition in descriptive linguistics [29]. In recent years, they have also become increasingly used in computational tasks, such as information extraction [5], machine translation [43], and parsing [42]. Among the purported advantages of dependency over phrase structure representations are conciseness, intuitive appeal, and closeness to semantic representations such as predicate-argument structures. On the more practical side, dependency representations are attractive due to the increasing availability of large corpora of dependency analyses, such as the Prague Dependency Treebank [19].

Classification and Clustering of Music for Novel Music Access Applications.
Thomas Lidy ,Andreas Rauber 
With an increasing number of people working with large music archives, advanced methods for automatic labeling and organization of music collections are required as these archives grow in size. Manual annotation and categorization is not feasible for massive collections of music. In the research domain of music information retrieval (MIR) a number of algorithms for the content-based description of music were developed, which perform the extraction of relevant features for the computation of similarity between pieces of music. This fundamental step enables a great range of applications for music retrieval and organization. With supervised machine learning, music can be classified into different kinds of categories, such as genres, artists or moods. Using unsupervised approaches such as the self-organizing map music can be clustered by similar style and visualized in a way that enables direct retrieval of similar music at a glance. In this chapter, we will review the most common audio feature extraction techniques, which serve as a basis for subsequent classification and clustering tasks. As an example, we will show how music is classified into a set of genres and how genre classification can be used for benchmarking. Moreover, the creation of the so-called \u201cmusic maps\u201d and their various visualizations is demonstrated, and an interactive application called \u201cPlaySOM\u201d is presented, with an interface which allows direct access to similar sounding pieces in a large music collection. Its mobile counterpart \u201cPocketSOMPlayer\u201d allows direct playback from a music map on a mobile device without having to browse lists. Both allow the convenient interactive creation of situation-based playlists.

Pipelining Software and Services for Language Processing.
Arif Bramantoro ,Ulrich Sch ,Toru Ishida 
This chapter reports on our experiences with combining two different platforms in natural language processing research, i.e. Heart of Gold and the Language Grid, to provide more language resources available on the Web. Heart of Gold is known as middleware architecture for pipelining deep and shallow natural language processing components. The Language Grid is one of the service grid infrastructures built on top of the Internet to provide pipelined language services. Both of these frameworks provide composite language services and components. Having Heart of Gold integrated in the Language Grid environment contributes to increased interoperability among various language services. The integrated architecture also supports the combination of pipelined language services in the Language Grid and the pipelined natural language processing components in Heart of Gold to provide a better quality of language services available on the Web. Thus, language services with different characteristics can be combined based on the concept of Web service with different treatment of each combination. An evaluation is presented to show that the overhead of the integration is not significant.

Ubiquitous Display Environments: An Overview.
Tsvi Kuflik 
Ubiquitous display environments are public spaces with various situated public displays. These displays are intended to provide relevant information to people in their vicinity, where these may include the regular inhabitants of the space as well as visitors. Their nature makes the development of such displays a multidisciplinary task that combines technological with aesthetic, sociological, and legal aspects. Research usually focuses on specific aspects while neglecting others, since it is intended to explore only a limited part. Here we try to take a step back and portray the big picture, showing how various aspects need to be addressed and integrated in order to support us in today\u2019s and tomorrow\u2019s ubiquitous display environments.

Linguistic Processing in a Mathematics Tutoring System: Cooperative Input Interpretation and Dialogue Modelling.
Magdalena Wolska ,Mark Buckley ,Helmut Horacek ,Ivana Kruijff-Korbayov ,Manfred Pinkal 
Formal domains, such as mathematics, require exact language to communicate the intended content. Special symbolic notations are used to express the semantics precisely, compactly, and unambiguously. Mathematical textbooks offer plenty of examples of concise, accurate presentations. This effective communication is enabled by interleaved use of formulas and natural language. Since natural language interaction has been shown to be an important factor in the efficiency of human tutoring [29], it would be desirable to enhance interaction with Intelligent Tutoring Systems for mathematics by allowing elements of mixed language combining the exactness of formal expressions with natural language flexibility.

Analysis and Prediction of Museum Visitors' Behavioral Pattern Types.
Tsvi Kuflik ,Zvi Boger ,Massimo Zancanaro 
Personalization in the \u201cmuseum visit\u201d scenario is extremely challenging, especially since in many cases visitors come to the museum for the first time, and it may be the last time in their life. There is therefore a need to generate an effective user model quickly without any prior knowledge. Furthermore, the initial definition of a user model is also challenging since it should be built in a non-intrusive manner. Understanding visitors\u2019 behavioral patterns may help in initializing their user models and supporting them better. This chapter reports three stages of analysis of behavior patterns of museum visitors. The first step assesses, following past ethnographic research, whether a distinct stereotype of behavior can be identified; the second shows that visitors\u2019 behavior is not always consistent; the third shows that, in spite of the inconsistency, prediction of visitor type, is possible.

Dimension Reduction.

When data objects that are the subject of analysis using machine learning techniques are described by a large number of features (i.e. the data are high dimension) it is often beneficial to reduce the dimension of the data. Dimension reduction can be beneficial not only for reasons of computational efficiency but also because it can improve the accuracy of the analysis. The set of techniques that can be employed for dimension reduction can be partitioned in two important ways; they can be separated into techniques that apply to

Communication methods and tools are key factors in developing online intercultural communities, especially when community members use their own mother tongue. This chapter introduces a case of an online intercultural community for international youths in NPO Pangaea. Youths and volunteer staff are from different countries and communication in this community is not English-based. Pictograms are used for youth communication and machine translations are used for staff communication. This chapter reports the participatory design and development processes of a pictogram communication system for youths and multilingual community site for staffs. Community-based communication tools such as Pangaea Staff Community Site receive benefits from the Language Grid technology in its aspect of a collective intelligence, because the Language Grid enables community users such as Pangaea volunteers to improve machine translation quality, for example, by adding a Pangaea community dictionary.

Program Search as a Path to Artificial General Intelligence.
Lukasz Kaiser 
It is difficult to develop an adequate mathematical definition of intelligence. Therefore we consider the general problem of searching for programs with specified properties and we argue, using the Church-Turing thesis, that it covers the informal meaning of intelligence. The program search algorithm can also be used to optimise its own structure and learn in this way. Thus, developing a practical program search algorithm is a way to create AI.

A Digital Product Memory Architecture for Cars.
Young-Jae Cho ,Florian Kuttig ,Markus Strassberger ,J 
The architecture of the car, acting as an integrated Digital Product Memory (DPM) with many sources, is introduced in this chapter. Static and nomadic sources such as sensors and data stores which are connected by a highly complex and heterogeneous communication network need an architecture adapted for the requirements of the automotive domain. Requirements and concepts are presented in detail. Consumer advantages and fulfilled requirements are summarized.

Sharing Multilingual Resources to Support Hospital Receptions.
Mai Miyabe ,Takashi Yoshino ,Aguri Shigeno 
In the medical field, there exists a serious problem with regard to communications between hospital staff and foreign patients. According to statistics, many countries worldwide have a low rate of literacy. Illiterate people engaging in multilingual communication face problems. Therefore, this situation requires the provision of support in various ways. Currently, medical translators accompany patients to medical care facilities, and the number of requests for medical translators has been increasing. However, medical translators cannot provide support at all times. Therefore, the medical field has high expectations from information technology. However, a useful system has yet to be developed and introduced in the medical field for practical use. In this chapter, we propose a multilingual communication support system called \u201cM3.\u201d M3 uses parallel texts and voice data to achieve high accuracy in communication between people speaking different languages. The Language Grid provides various parallel texts provided by a multilingual parallel text sharing system and parallel text providers. The proposed system can obtain and share parallel texts using Web services via the Language Grid.

Applying Digital Product Memories in Industrial Production.
Peter Stephan ,Markus Eich ,J ,Martin Rosjat ,Roberto Hengst 
Industrial production and supply chains face increased demands for mass customization and tightening regulations on the traceability of goods, leading to higher requirements concerning flexibility, adaptability, and transparency of processes. Technologies for the \u201cInternet of Things\u201d such as smart products and semantic representations pave the way for future factories and supply chains to fulfill these challenging market demands. In this chapter a backend-independent approach for information exchange in open-loop production processes based on Digital Product Memories (DPMs) is presented. By storing order-related data directly on the item, relevant lifecycle information is attached to the product itself. In this way, information handover between several stages of the value chain with focus on the manufacturing phase of a product has been realized. In order to report best practices regarding the application of DPM in the domain of industrial production, system prototype implementations focusing on the use case of producing and handling a

Service Supervision for Runtime Service Management.
Masahiro Tanaka ,Toru Ishida ,Yohei Murakami 
The Language Grid offers language services with a standardized interface and different non-functional properties. This allows us to create a specialized composite service for our own goals simply by selecting the appropriate services. The language services are, however, provided in various formats with their own policies. In an environment for service-collective intelligence, it is essential to have many service providers join by strongly ensuring that their policies are satisfied. In doing this, we therefore we have to solve the following problems. First, service composition relies on the products of various stakeholders that belong to different organizations, such as service products and composite service designers. This makes it difficult to modify existing services in line with given requirements. Next, selection of services may impose constraints on execution. We therefore often need to apply a certain amount of runtime adaptation toward a composite service in order to enforce given policies. To solve these problems, we proposed an architecture for runtime service management called Service Supervision. Service Supervision provides meta-level execution functions for composite services. These allow operators to modify behaviors of a composite service without changing its model. Service Supervision is also capable of effectively managing a comprehensive process of runtime service selection and adaptation in order to ensure the service providers\u2019 policies are satisfied. We implemented the Service Supervision prototype and showed that applying meta-level execution control barely decreases performance.

An ERP-Approach to Study Age Differences in Cognitive Control Processes.
Jutta Kray ,Ben Eppinger 
The flexible adaptation to changes in the environment is one important feature of intelligent behaviour and is associated with the ability to efficiently control one's own processing. Cognitive control refers to the ability to guide thoughts and actions in accord with internal task goals. Controlling one's own behaviour is particularly required in situations that involve the flexible switching between multiple tasks, the selection and maintenance of task-relevant and the inhibition of taskirrelevant information, as well as the monitoring of error and conflict information (e.g. [22, 42, 47]).

The Sense of Vision: Gestures and Real Objects.
Jens Racky ,Michael L ,Hans R 
Natural human communication is based on visual and acoustical signals. Thus a technical system needs the same senses to allow intuitive interaction. The acoustical interface has been described in earlier chapters. In this chapter we concentrate on the perception of conscious visual utterances, for example, hand gestures and handling of dedicated (real) objects, e.g., paper documents.

Challenges and Solutions of Ubiquitous User Modeling.
Tsvi Kuflik ,Judy Kay ,Bob Kummerfeld 
Ubiquitous display environments are public places with various situated public displays. These displays are intended to provide relevant information to people in their vicinity, where this may include the regular inhabitants of the space as well as visitors. For this latter group, it is particularly challenging to provide relevant information. This is because personalization relies on the availability of information about the individual (or group). Ubiquitous user modeling research tries to address this challenge. This chapter provides a brief introduction to user modeling and user modeling techniques and then elaborates on ubiquitous user modeling, its challenges, and the state-of-the-art research. It aims to provide a broad introduction to key approaches to user modeling and personalization as a starting point for the reader who wants to appreciate the challenges of personalization for ubiquitous display environments.

Cascading Translation Services.
Rie Tanaka ,Yohei Murakami ,Toru Ishida 
The Language Grid offers a broad array of language services such as dictionaries and translation, and cascading them enables people in different parts of the world to communicate with one another in their mother tongue. However, when cascading several translation services, words\u2019 meanings often drift due to the inconsistency, asymmetry and intransitivity of word selection. In this section, we propose context-based coordination to maintain the consistency of word meanings. For this, we put forth a method to automatically generate multilingual equivalent terms based on the use of bilingual dictionaries. We generated trilingual equivalent noun terms and implemented a Japanese-to-German-and-back translation, cascading four translation services. The evaluation results showed that the generated terms can cover over 58% of all nouns. Translation quality was improved by 41% for all sentences, and the quality rating for all sentences increased by an average of 0.47 points on a five-point scale.
